# clock angle problem

What is the measure of the small angle formed between the hour hand and the minute hand?
note: The angle is measured in degrees. The time is based on a 12-hour clock.

## solution

- The clock is circular in shape, this means one round is 360°
- The hour hand rotates through 360° in 12 hours or 30° per hour (360 / 12 = 30)
- The minute hand rotates through 360° in 60 minutes or 6° per minute (360 / 60 = 6)
- When the minute hand rotates the hour hand will also rotate
- The angle between the hands = **| angle formed by hour hand - angle formed by the minute hand |** (we take [the absolute value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_value) to guarantee a positive angle)
- to get the measure of the small angle then subtract it from 360 degrees if it is greater than 180 degrees.

### example

1. What is the angle between the hour hand and the minute hand at 3:15?

- We have 3 hours and 15 minutes, converting the 15 minutes into hours gives us 0.25 hours, so we have 3.25 hours
- The angle formed by the hour hand = 3.25 hours \* 30° = 97.5°
- We have 15 minutes, so
- The angle formed by the minute hand = 15 minute \* 6° = 90°
- The angle formed between the two hands = |97.5° - 90°| = 7.5°

2. What is the angle between the hour hand and the minute hand at 1:45?

- We have 1 hour and 45 minutes, converting the 45 minutes into hours gives us 0.75 hours, so we have 1.75 hours
- The angle formed by the hour hand = 1.75 hours \* 30° = 52.5°
- We have 45 minutes, so
- The angle formed by the minute hand = 45 minute \* 6° = 270°
- The angle formed between the two hands = |52.5° -270°| = 217.5°
- The angle is over 180°, so to get the smaller angle simply, 360° - 217.5° = 142.5°
